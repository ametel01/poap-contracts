# Starknet Proof of Attendance

A deployable smart contract that allows the creation and managment of proof of attendance docs.

A blockchain proof of attendance protocol is a system that uses blockchain technology to record and verify attendance at events or meetings. It utilizes smart contracts to automatically record and confirm attendance, and the information is stored on the blockchain, providing a tamper-proof and immutable record of attendance. The protocol allows for secure and transparent tracking of attendance, and can be used for various applications such as tracking employee attendance, tracking attendance at conferences and events, and more.
